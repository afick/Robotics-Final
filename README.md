### Aneesh, Carter, Kevin, Alex

**Project Objective**: Program a robot that will explore and map a dynamic environment. This environment may have a static component (which may be unknown) with dynamic elements that modify the robot's motion.

**Motivation**: Autonomous Vehicles (Pre-Computation and Revision of Optimal Path, Discovery/Update of Original Map)
