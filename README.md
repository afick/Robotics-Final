# Robotics Final Project
### Aneesh, Carter, Kevin, Alex

**Project Objective**: Program a robot that will explore and map (with path planning) a dynamic environment. This environment may have a static component (which may be unknown) with dynamic elements that modify the robot's motion. Then the robot will visit target destinations, doging moving obstacles along its path.

**Motivation**: Autonomous Vehicles (Pre-Computation and Revision of Optimal Path, Discovery/Update of Original Map)
